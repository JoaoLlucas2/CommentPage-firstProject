-> Comment Page Project - Web

The Comment Section is a simple web project that allows users to post and see their comments in "real-time". In this Project, i'm putting into practice some basic fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to improve my front-end development skills.

*Future improvements will include some basic back-end logic and integrations with database technologies such as MySQL.

My goal is to enhance my knowledge and learn new web development skills.
 
Sorry for any english mistakes, i'm learning yet.
